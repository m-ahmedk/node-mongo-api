  "description": "A Node.js project that centralizes error handling in an application by implementing a middleware. This middleware is responsible for catching all errors thrown by the application and returning a custom error message along with the relevant HTTP status code. If any errors go unhandled, a default internal server error (HTTP 500) with a custom message will be assigned. Additionally, all errors are logged using Winston logger and stored in a file. The logs are automatically deleted after 3 days, ensuring consistent, structured, and comprehensive error handling in the application. Upon running the project, it opens a Swagger documentation page displaying all the requests, their descriptions, and the methods available in the application.",
